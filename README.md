This project is strongely inspired from [**Small Star Empires**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/archonagames/small-star-empires) by [Archona Games](http://www.archonagames.com/) from KickStarter

The purpose of this project is only to learn clojurescript by using an actual game with all its set of rules. The rules are quite simple - thus making the game a good candidate for a full implementation - whereas the possibility of the game is quite impressive.
Of course, I hope it will also do some advertisement for this game, encouraging you to buy to the board game!

:warning: I'm neither a designer nor part of the game's authors - just a developer :alien:

## Overview

FIXME: Write a paragraph about the library/project and highlight its goals.

## Developer Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL. 

## Diary

Initial Layout:

```
$ lein new figwheel small_star_empires -- --reagent
```
